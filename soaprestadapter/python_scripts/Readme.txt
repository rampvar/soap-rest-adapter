============================================
WSDL/XSD to Java Class Generator & Storage
============================================

This script automates:
  - Downloading WSDL and XSD files.
  - Generating Java classes from WSDL using Apache CXF's wsdl2java.
  - Storing the generated .class files into a MySQL database table.

üìå REQUIREMENTS:
--------------------------------------------
1Ô∏è‚É£ Python Packages:
     pip install mysql-connector-python

2Ô∏è‚É£ Java:
   - JDK must be installed.
   - Set JAVA_HOME correctly in the script or your system.
   - Example: JDK 21

3Ô∏è‚É£ Apache CXF:
   - Download and extract Apache CXF (tested with version 4.0.4).
   - The 'wsdl2java.bat' must be available under:
     C:\Program Files\Java\apache-cxf-4.0.4\bin

4Ô∏è‚É£ MySQL Database:
   - A MySQL server must be running.
   - The DB name, user, password, host and port are defined in the script.

üìå HOW TO USE WSDL URL?:[WSDL+XSD] url and without XSD url
--------------------------------------------
‚úÖ Using WSDL with a linked XSD
-----------------------------------------------------
- If your WSDL depends on an external XSD file, make sure to list the
  WSDL **first** and the XSD **immediately after** in the `WSDL_XSD_URLS` list.

  Example:
  WSDL_XSD_URLS = [
      "https://example.com/myService.wsdl",
      "https://example.com/schema1.xsd"
  ]

- The script will detect that the `.wsdl` is followed by a `.xsd` and
  will download both, treating them as a single unit.

- You can pair multiple WSDL+XSD sets in the same list:
  Example:
  WSDL_XSD_URLS = [
      "https://example.com/service1.wsdl",
      "https://example.com/schema1.xsd",
      "https://example.com/service2.wsdl",
      "https://example.com/schema2.xsd"
  ]
-----------------------------------------------------
‚úÖ Using WSDL **without** XSD
-----------------------------------------------------
- If your WSDL does not need an external XSD, just list the `.wsdl`
  by itself.

  Example:
  WSDL_XSD_URLS = [
      "https://example.com/service3.wsdl"
  ]

- The script will process this WSDL on its own

2Ô∏è‚É£ Update `DB_CONFIG` in the script with your own MySQL credentials.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure your JAVA_HOME and Apache CXF paths are set correctly.

   Example in script:
     env["JAVA_HOME"] = r"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21"
     env["PATH"] = rf"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21\bin;C:\Program Files\Java\apache-cxf-4.0.4\bin;{env['PATH']}"

4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the script:
     python your_script_name.py

5Ô∏è‚É£ The script will do:
     - Download the WSDL and any linked XSD files.
     - Run `wsdl2java` to generate Java source files.
     - Compile them to .class files.
     - Insert all .class files as a single blob for each wsdl url in `tbl_generated_wsdl_classes`.

üìå OUTPUT:
--------------------------------------------
- Generated class files are stored under the `generated_classes` folder.
- The `tbl_generated_wsdl_classes` table stores:
   - Source WSDL URL
   - Binary .class data (combined)
   - Generation timestamp
